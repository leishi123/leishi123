Hello! I am Lei Shi, a physicist and working in the field of interdisciplinary R&D. I am a big fan of sci-fi, and enthusiastic about robots and automation. This blog is used to document what I have learned and experienced, and some of my thoughts on everything else. I hope you will find something helpful.
